They absolutely do and better yet, they do so effectively, safely and naturally. Let’s break that down:<\/p><p><strong>Effectively:<\/strong> Thermo Recovery Wear products are made with a high-quality nano bamboo charcoal fiber referred to as “the Black Diamond” in Japan, China and the rest of Southeast Asia. <\/p><p>There’s a lot of bamboo products out there (just check Amazon) but very few sell bamboo charcoal and furthermore, even less sell the high-quality fiber that meets the qualification of Black Diamond quality. We only source Black Diamond quality fiber which is why our prices are higher than what you’ll find just about elsewhere. <\/p><p>In layman’s terms, when you wear Thermo Recovery Wear products, your body heat activates the fabric semiconductors (bamboo charcoal) which then increase blood flow bringing more blood and consequently oxygen and nutrients to the target area. <\/p><p>On a chemical level, your body heat activates the fabric semiconductors which then release negative ions that activate cellular vibrations which in turn increase blood flow. That increased blood flow delivers more oxygen and nutrients to the target area which results in less pain, less swelling and faster recovery. <\/p><p><strong>Safely:<\/strong> Our recovery wear products couldn’t be more safe to use. You simply slip them on and let them do their thing. They’re comfortable so you can wear them 24\/7 and there is absolutely no side-effects associated with them (vs. NSAIDS and messy creams for example). Thermo is easily the safest way to speed your recovery or alleviate chronic muscle and joint pain. <\/p><p><strong>Naturally:<\/strong> As explained above, our products are made from popular fabrics (recycled when possible) and high-quality bamboo charcoal fiber. That’s it. No pills to take. No messy creams to rub on. Your body heat is the catalyst. All we’re doing is leveraging it to turbocharge the body’s healing process safely and naturally. <\/p>"}},"0994ff4f-555a-431e-b7e1-92ba9e233fe7":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"question":"<p>Can you tell me more about “The Black Diamond” (Bamboo Charcoal Fiber)?<\/p>","answer":"<p>With pleasure! <\/p><p>Relatively speaking, bamboo fabric technology is still relatively new, initially gaining momentum in Asia in the mid-90’s and growing in popularity around the globe ever since. It’s really quite impressive just how many different uses have been found for the humble bamboo tree. Everyone knows about its use in bedding and construction but bamboo is also used in carpeting, clothing, accessories (like sunglass frames and wrist watches), fuel, furniture, paper, nappies and so on. Here’s a <a href=\"https:\/\/econation.one\/bamboo\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">link<\/span><\/a> to a fantastic resource on bamboo. <\/p><p>While the bamboo fabric technology is still relatively new, only gaining momentum in Asia in the mid-1990s, its uses are growing widespread ranging from clothing to carpeting to bedding.   As they look towards more environmentally friendly fabrics that offer the same feel and durability of synthetic fabrics, bamboo charcoal is a surprising but strong contender.<\/p><p>Specific to the bamboo charcoal fiber we use in our products, the bamboo charcoal is created by heating bamboo at temperatures of 800 degrees and then the charcoal itself is processed and mixed in with fabrics. This process is known as nano-technology which is defined as the:<\/p><p>“understanding, manipulation, and control of matter at the length mentioned above, thus, the physical, chemical, and biological properties of materials (individual atoms, molecules, and bulk matter) can be engineered, synthesized, or altered to develop the next generation of improved materials, devices, structures, and systems.”  <\/p><p>Hence, textile attributes such as softness, durability, water resistance and breathability can be enhanced with the use of Nanotechnology which is exactly what we are doing here at Thermo Recovery Wear. <\/p>"}},"280ea077-8d2d-498a-bb50-855c5d937e85":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"question":"<p>What are the benefits of using bamboo charcoal fabric vs. other fabrics?<\/p>","answer":"<p>We’re so glad you asked because there are a ton! <\/p><p>Here are the most popular positive qualities of bamboo charcoal fabric in our estimation:<\/p><p><strong>Easier on Sensitive Skin:<\/strong> This is a big one for us given the products we sell. The fabric inhibits bacterial metabolism causing fewer allergic skin reactions than other fibers sterilized with antimicrobial agents. <\/p><p><strong>Reduces Static Buildup:<\/strong> Bamboo charcoal fabric is a conductive material so it keeps a balanced charge within the fabric to help reduce static buildup. <\/p><p><strong>Superior Absorption & Deodorizing Ability:<\/strong> Very important to us given that some customers use our products while running outside or very light physical activity. This trait is due to the highly porous structure of the bamboo fabric. <\/p><p><strong>Anti-Pilling:<\/strong> Bamboo charcoal fiber can reach level 3.5 ~ level 4.5 with regards to its anti-fluff, anti-pilling effect. Said another way, the product stays durable longer over time and use than comparable fabrics. <\/p><p><strong>Far Infrared Radiation properties:<\/strong> Bamboo charcoal fiber disperses far infrared (FIR) radiation to activate human cells, increase cellular energy, accelerate the speed of blood circulation, and promote and improve body metabolism.<\/p><p><strong>Superior Washing and Durability: <\/strong>Bamboo charcoal fibers are quick-drying and because the bamboo charcoal nanoparticles are embedded in the fabric rather than simply coated onto the surface, the fabric can be washed numerous times with no adverse effect on the charcoal qualities.<\/p><p><strong>Moisture Regulation:<\/strong> Bamboo charcoal fabric has a cross-section filled with various micro-gaps and micro-holes so compared to conventional fabrics, it is much better at moisture absorption and ventilation. This means the fabric keeps the wearer dry and comfortable even on hot days.<\/p><p><strong>Thermal Regulation:<\/strong> The highly porous nature of bamboo charcoal also lets it act as an insulator against the cold while also retaining heat.  According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itri.org.tw\/\">ITRI <\/a>test results, when a 500W halogen light shone on the bamboo charcoal yarn for 10 minutes, the yarn emits far more infrared rays 87% ~ 92%, and warm up temperature of 10 degrees Celsius, which is much higher than for instance wool’s 5 degrees Celsius.<\/p>"}},"0c35b099-075c-401a-b8de-754164c97ea5":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"question":"<p>Do you use Germanium and Carbon in any of your products?<\/p>","answer":"<p>Our goal moving forward is only to use recycled and sustainable fabrics so as to reduce, if not eliminate, our environmental footprint but currently, yes, we do offer products made with germanium and carbon. <\/p><p>For context, bamboo and charcoal are sustainable in terms of how they are sourced. Neither bamboo nor charcoal need to be mined or extracted. Bamboo is obviously a plant and an extremely fast growing one at that and charcoal is the by-product of burned wood which theoretically, can easily be replaced by replanting.

We’re starting off by designing and offering our products by use case. Specifically, we’re currently offering three collections: Classic, Lite and Pro. Our Classic collection offers the germanium carbon products that we are slowly phasing out. These products can be used indoors as well as outdoors for a multitude of reasons but they are a bit thicker, heavier and hotter than our other products. Our Lite Collection is really our core collection and was designed with the home-based user in-mind.
